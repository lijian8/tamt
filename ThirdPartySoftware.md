  * PostgreSQL ~ 40MB
  * PostGIS ~ 4MB
  * Python ~ 20MB
  * [JOSM](JavaOpenStreetMapEditor.md) ~ 5MB

So, even before we _think_ about installing TAMT, we have to download, install and configure 85MB worth of third-part software. Add another 15MB for python libraries that we'll need (UI, etc) and we are up to 100MB. And this method depends on the user being able to download, install and troubleshoot these packages if their OS configuration is even slightly irregular.

Makes me think that a 2GB VirtualBox might be worth the download hassle, if we have total control over the OS and third party software configuration. Here is a link to [mini linux distributions](http://www.linuxlinks.com/Distributions/Mini_Distributions/). And another for [PostGIS on a stick](http://www.archaeogeek.com/download.php).
